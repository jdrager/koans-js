# Koans

The JavaScript Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment. The goal is to
learn the JavaScript language, syntax, structure, and some common functions and
objects.


## Structure

The "koans" - or lessons - are specifc areas of learning. Each of the koans are
presented in an order - the "path to enlightenment" - to gradually build your
skills.

Each koan builds up your knowledge of JavaScript and builds upon itself. It
will stop at the first place you need to correct.

Some koans simply need to have the correct answer substituted for an incorrect
one. Some, however, require you to supply your own answer. When you see `__`
(a double underscore), take that as a hint to supply your own code in order to
change the failing test to passing.

JavaScript Koans has been heavily inspired by [Ruby Koans] and to a lesser
extent [ClojureScript Koans] and [JavaScript Koans].
